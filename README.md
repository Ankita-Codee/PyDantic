# PyDantic

📦 Why We Use Pydantic
This project leverages Pydantic to define and manage structured data throughout the workflow. Pydantic ensures that data is validated, type-safe, and easily traceable across all components — especially important in complex, agentic workflows like LangGraph.

✅ Benefits of Using Pydantic
🔐 Data Validation:
* Automatically checks that incoming data matches expected types and raises meaningful errors for incorrect input.

📘 Type Annotations & Autocompletion:
* Integrates smoothly with Python’s typing system — improving code readability, maintainability, and developer productivity (IDE support, linting, etc.).

🔁 Serialization / Deserialization:
* Easily convert models to and from dictionaries or JSON for APIs, logging, and state tracking.

📊 Schema Generation:
* Supports auto-generating JSON Schemas for documentation or frontend integration.

📈 State Management for Agents:
* Enables clean tracking and updating of state across different nodes in LangGraph or similar agent-based workflows.
