ðŸ“Œ Why Use Pydantic?
Pydantic is used to define structured, type-safe data models in Python. It provides robust tools to validate, serialize, and manage state, making it ideal for agent-based workflows like LangGraph.

âœ… Key Benefits:
Data Validation
Ensures input data conforms to expected types and structure automatically. Invalid data raises helpful errors early.

Type Safety + Autocompletion
Works well with type annotations. Enables better IDE support, linting, and debugging.

Serialization / Deserialization
Easily convert data to/from JSON or dicts â€” crucial for APIs and logging in pipelines.

Traceable State in Workflows
In LangGraph, Pydantic models help track and update agent state between nodes clearly and predictably.

Schema Generation
Automatically generates schemas (e.g., JSON Schema) for documentation, frontend validation, etc.

Cleaner Code
Reduces boilerplate â€” you define models declaratively with fields and types.
